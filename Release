Announcing the release of Perl Module Algorithm::Tree::NCA Version 0.01

Algorithm::Tree::NCA  - Constant-time retrieval of nearest common ancestor

This package provides constant-time retrieval of the Nearest Common
Ancestor (NCA) of nodes in a tree. The implementation is based on an
algorithm by Harel and Tarjan which can, after linear-time (and
linear-space) preprocessing, retrieve the nearest common ancestor of
two nodes in constant time.

This release also contains a comparison between this algorithm and the
naive straight-forward implementation of the same algorithm with
linear complexity but with a low constant factor.
